# Real-Time Sign Language Recognition System (EchoFlow)

## Overview
Welcome to the Real-Time Sign Language Recognition System project, developed by Ezequiel Bellver. This project aims to develop a real-time sign language recognition (SLR) system specifically tailored for British Sign Language (BSL) gestures, focusing on a studio setup with optimal lighting conditions. The system will utilize computer vision and deep learning techniques to accurately interpret BSL gestures from live video input.
